## About

This program demonstrates the minimization of the elastic energy of discrete elastic rod.
Starting from the random configuration, the minimization make the rod return to the initial un-deformed configuration.   

The 3x3 block sparse matrix data structure is defined such that it allows branching rods or coupling with other 3D deformation.
