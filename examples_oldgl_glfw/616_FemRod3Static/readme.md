## About
This demo shows the minimization of the deformation energy of the discrete elastic rod. 
Starting from random configuration, 
the minimization of the deformation energy leads to the initial un-deformed configuration.

[613_FemRod](../613_FemRod/readme.md) solves the similar problem, 
but the formulation of the system matrix is specialized for the discretization of hairs.



## Technical detail
The implementation of the rod is based on following two papers:
